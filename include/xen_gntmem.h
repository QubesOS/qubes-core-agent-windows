   grants_out should be a pointer to an array of grant_ref_t large enough to handle n_pages grants. 
   address_out will be assigned the user-accessible address of the granted pages on success. 
   Be aware that the pages so granted are virtually but not necessarily (pseudo-)physically contiguous.
   The return value is an opaque pointer to a handle representing this grant, or NULL on error,
   in which case the out parameters are assigned nothing useful.

   If the thread in which this is called terminates, the shared region will be rescinded as if
   gntmem_rescind_grants had been called, and access to (*grants_out) will result in a page fault.
